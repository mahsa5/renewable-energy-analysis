# 🌍 Global Renewable Energy Production Analysis (1990-2017)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes global trends in renewable energy production across four major sources from 1990 to 2017:
- Hydroelectric Power
- Biofuel
- Solar Photovoltaic (PV)
- Geothermal Energy

## 🎯 Key Findings

### 1. Hydroelectric Power: The Dominant Force
- Grew from 2,192 TWh (1990) to 4,197 TWh (2017)
- Accounts for **71%** of total renewable energy in 2017
- Growth rate: **91.5%**

### 2. Solar Energy: The Revolution
- Started near zero (0.09 TWh in 1990)
- Reached 444 TWh by 2017
- Growth rate: **492,733%** (nearly 5000x!)
- Shows massive technological advancement and cost reduction

### 3. Biofuel: Explosive Growth
- Increased from 4 TWh to 1,127 TWh
- Growth rate: **28,954%** (290x)
- Second-largest renewable source by 2017 (19% share)

### 4. Geothermal: Steady Progress
- Grew from 36 TWh to 85 TWh
- Growth rate: **134%**
- Location-dependent but reliable

## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes 7 comprehensive visualizations:
- Trend analysis of all energy sources
- Growth rate comparisons
- 1990 vs 2017 comparison
- Stacked area chart showing energy mix evolution
- Total renewable energy growth with trend line

## 🌱 Environmental Impact
The data reveals a clear global shift toward renewable energy diversification, especially after 2010. The exponential growth of solar energy and rapid expansion of biofuel production indicate strong momentum in the transition away from fossil fuels.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
